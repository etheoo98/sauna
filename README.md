## Assignment description
### The American in the sauna
This assignment requires an American to enter a temperature for a sauna heater, until they enter
a temperature that is considered adequate. To check this, we must have a temperature that indicates the lowest
acceptable temperature and one indicating the highest acceptable temperature.
Unfortunately, our dear sauna visitor only understands Fahrenheit, while
the sauna heater only understands Celsius. Therefore, you have had to write a program
that converts the input from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
The optimal temperature for the sauna is 75 째C, but the acceptable temperature ranges from 73 to 77 째C.
This must be governed entirely in the condition clause within the loop.
If the number is less than the minimum acceptable temperature, the program should
write that it is too cold and you have to turn it up a bit. Then let
the sauna visitor set a new value on the sauna unit and repeat the loop.

In this assignment, you must handle the following:
1. Exception handling
2. Methods
3. Conditions

Since the American can enter a temperature in Fahrenheit, this means a value of 167 째F (=75 째C), but of course they won't know about this, since it's their first sauna visit ever.
